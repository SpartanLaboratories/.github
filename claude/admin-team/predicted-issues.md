# Predicted issues

What the admin team expects may go wrong, each with its proposed resolution and
a count of the times it has actually happened. The rule for keeping this list
is in `agents/admin-team.md` (How the team works, **Predicted issues**). Dates
are UTC.

## A confirm-only setup-branch at step 3 finds the branch missing

```json
{"id":"p1","count":0,"last":null}
```

- **Proposed resolution:** the run stops and tells the user; a branch gone after
  step 1 may mean lost research commits.
- **Predicted:** the user, at the admin team's console, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A sync meets a conflict with a code file, which has no defined resolution

```json
{"id":"p2","count":0,"last":null}
```

- **Proposed resolution:** treat it as the README case: leave the merge open,
  return `result.conflicts`, the run fixes the markers in its worktree,
  re-verifies, and resends with a fresh qa.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A conflict mixes a README or CHANGELOG with a code file

```json
{"id":"p3","count":0,"last":null}
```

- **Proposed resolution:** the merge stays open only when every conflicted file
  is `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`, otherwise as for a code conflict.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A run needs to see which files merged over cleanly

```json
{"id":"p4","count":0,"last":null}
```

- **Proposed resolution:** leave it in the executor's Overlap report; add
  `result.overlap` to `done` only if something needs it.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A closed board needs an approximate-bounds backfill

```json
{"id":"p5","count":0,"last":null}
```

The wording in `GUIDANCE` and `RULES` defines `asBuilt.approx`.

- **Proposed resolution:** leave the text as the field's definition.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A dashboards rule change would reach a closed board

```json
{"id":"p6","count":0,"last":null}
```

The route is "New dashboard rules reach old dashboards" in `admin-team.md`.

- **Proposed resolution:** that standing rule covers open boards only; say so
  with one word.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A presenter job regenerates work-board files at a sync

```json
{"id":"p7","count":0,"last":null}
```

`presenter.md` doesn't describe this.

- **Proposed resolution:** one sentence naming the regeneration beside its
  state-board text.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A publish, or a repository creation, is denied with [Create Public Surface]

```json
{"id":"p8","count":2,"last":"2026-11-09"}
```

The permission system raises the denial.

- **Proposed resolution:** retry once at the user's word; if denied again, a
  narrow temporary allow rule or the user runs it.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, seeding this list from the encounters below,
  2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - 2026-11-09: WebTools #99 publish; cleared on retry.
  - 2026-11-09: `phase0-rehearsal-a` repository creation; cleared under a narrow
    allow rule.

## An encountered issue is not in this tracker

```json
{"id":"p9","count":0,"last":null}
```

- **Proposed resolution:** add it as a new entry with count 1, then prompt the
  user with it and its counter.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.

## A count changes in this mirrored file

```json
{"id":"p10","count":0,"last":null}
```

- **Proposed resolution:** the coordinator writes the count and the change rides
  the next `mirror-sync`, so the public copy lags slightly.
- **Predicted:** the admin team, 2026-11-09.
- **Encounters:**
  - None yet.
